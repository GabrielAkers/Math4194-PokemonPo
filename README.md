# Math4194-PokemonPo


Basically there's a 10x10 grid of walkable streets, no diagonal movement, over a 4x4 mile city center. Pokes spawn on average
every 30 minutes and dissapear after exactly 15. Not all spawn locations are equal with some being clearly favored over others.
The pokes are worth points ranging from 1-20 with the higher values being much more rare than the the lower valued ones. 
The objective is to gain as many points as possible in 12 hours.

This project is a simulation for Pokemon Po intended to be used as a way to verify and present the mathematical model of the game
described and built by myself, Carly and Craig for MATH4194 in Spring 2020.
