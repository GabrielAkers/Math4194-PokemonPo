# Math4194-PokemonPo


Basically there's a 10x10 grid of walkable streets, no diagonal movement, over a 4x4 mile city center. Pokes spawn on average
every 30 minutes and disspear after exactly 15. The pokes are worth points ranging from 1-20 with the higher values being
much more rare. The objective is to gain as many points as possible in 12 hours.

This project is a simulation for Pokemon Po intended to be used as a way to verify and present the mathematical model of the game
described and built by myself, Carly and Craig for MATH4194 in Spring 2020.
